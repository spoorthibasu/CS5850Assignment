Hence a simple upload synchronization of your file collection under /home/user/documents will be done with:

    java -jar jdrivesync-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -u -l "/home/user/documents"

When you start jdrivesync for the first time it will print an authentication URL. You will have to point your browser
to this URL, login with your Google account and grant jdrivesync the requested privileges. After having clicked on
'Accept' you will be redirected to a new page that displays an authentication token. Copy this token to
the command line and press Enter.

Now jdrivesync will create a file called .jdrivesync in your home directory. This is your authentication file.
As long as jdrivesync will find a valid authentication file in your home directory, it will use it. When you
want to use an alternative file, you can specify that on the command line:

     java -jar jdrivesync-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -u -l "/home/user/documents" -a "my-auth-file.properties"

You can also exclude certain files from being uploaded/downloaded. Just create a text document that contains file name
patterns and provide the path to this file using the option -i:

    java -jar jdrivesync-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -u -l "/home/user/documents" -i .jdrivesyncignore

The patterns should follow these rules:

* Blank lines are ignored.
* Leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
* If the line starts with # it is treated as comment. If the first character should be #, use \\#.
* All patterns are seen relative from the root of your local directory (example: doc/git.html).
* Use / as path separator (and not the backslash).
* Use \* as wildcard for a file name. The pattern doc/*.html ignores all files ending with .html inside doc.
* If the pattern starts with \*\*/ (e.g. \*\*/foo) it will match all files or folders named foo inside the file hierarchy.
* If the pattern ends with /\*\* (e.g. foo/\*\*) it will match all files and folders below the directory foo.
* If the pattern contains /\*\*/ (e.g. foo/\*\*/xy) it will expand to zero or more directories that are in between foo and xy.
